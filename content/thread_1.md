# Twitter Thread: "Stop Renting Intelligence"

**Tweet 1:**
Stop renting your intelligence.

You pay $20/mo to ChatGPT to *chat*.
The top 1% are paying $0/mo to *agents* that *work*.

There is a difference. And it's costing you money. 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
ChatGPT is a tool. You use it.
Clawdbot (OpenClaw) is an employee. It uses itself.

It lives on your server.
It has your files.
It texts you on Telegram/WhatsApp.
It works while you sleep.

It doesn't ask "How can I help?". It says "I finished the task."

**Tweet 3:**
The problem? Setting it up requires a PhD in Linux.
Terminals. SSH keys. Docker containers.

Most people give up and go back to the chat box.
They choose convenience over power.

**Tweet 4:**
We fixed that.

Introducing Agentic Setup.
We spin up your own private, secured AI infrastructure on DigitalOcean.
You get the keys. You own the data.

No monthly markup. Just a one-time setup fee.

**Tweet 5:**
Imagine waking up to:
- "I scraped 50 leads."
- "I wrote your newsletter."
- "I monitored your competitors."

Instead of waking up and typing prompts.

**Tweet 6:**
The future is agentic.
Don't be left typing in a box.
